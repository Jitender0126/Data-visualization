# Data Preparation 

We need to explore the dataset and find the hidden pattern in it. We take the below steps to achieve this.
1. Load the dataset` data2` and specify the Data Extent in properties window with respresentation as `Surface`. The values used for Data Extent as listed below.
<br>

    | Property | Value: |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| 
    | X | 255 |
    | Y | 255 |
    | Z | 511 |
    | Read As Image Stack | Y |

2. We apply the `Contour filter` to find the iso surfaces in the dataset with a `Linear Series` of `10 data points` with range `[0,2871]`, however this would result in a very noisy result which need to be filtered further. A short summary below of the setting is below.
`Colormap` used is `X Ray` preset.
<br>

    | Property | Value |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| 
    | Sample size | 10 |
    | Range | 0 - 2871 |
    |  Type | Linear |
    |  Compute Normals | Y |
    |  Compute Gradients | N |
    |  Compute Scalars | Y |
    |  Compute Triangles | Y |
    |  Representation | Surface |
    | Data Axes Grid | N |

# Improvements
1. This visualization is limited to the representation of object in the dataset.
2. It could be better visualized with a cross-section of the object, revealing more details and interesting information.
3. There are no physical attributes highlighted that could help differentiate parts of the object easily.
